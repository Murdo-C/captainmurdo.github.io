I built a plugin for the amazing e-ink [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com) device.

My TRMNL was delivered last week and already I love this little thing. It provides ambient information through plugins you can install or build yourself. Immediately I set it up n our kitchen and added a simple calendar, the weather forecast, and SHOP stock price views.

I had a few ideas for plugins I'd personally find valuable. So armed with ChatGPT Plus I went to work on a simple schedule view of City of Toronto's 2025 waste collection data. The city releases JSON files every year and TRMNL plugins are built using Liquid, an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby, so I was in familiar territory.
