title: Neobanked - 003 A maturing market
---

Neobanks are taking steps to solidify their capabilities and customer offer.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 002 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any initial thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

Savings are deposited with Paragon Bank and protected by the FSCS up to a value of £85,000 for eligible customers.

The neobanks are maturing in both their product portfolio and their internal management capabilities. I expect this to continue through 2020 as we see established financial institutions ramp up their digital-only offerings. Customer acquisition will likely become more expensive and more difficult as a result; the neobanks' word-of-mouth marketing model will be tested as competition intensifies.
