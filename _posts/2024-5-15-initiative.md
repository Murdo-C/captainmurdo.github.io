I constantly find myself coming back to a very simple but actionable framework when coaching team members about initiative and proactivity.

There are six common levels of initiative:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Wait until told (lowest initiative)
2. ﻿﻿﻿Ask what to do
3. ﻿﻿﻿Recommend, then take aligned action
4. ﻿﻿﻿Act, but advise at once
5. ﻿﻿﻿Act on own, then routinely report
6. Do it ahead of time because it will need to be done; people realize it later when it's happening (highest initiative)

Simple, right? **There is one caveat, though.** It’s important not to jump straight to the highest level(s). You should only operate at the higher levels when trust with your team or lead is built *and* you’re clear on the company or team's strategic direction. Moving too quickly without these foundations can make actions seem uncoordinated or disruptive.

So, take a moment to evaluate where you currently stand within these levels — potentially within your team, project, or your relationship with your lead — and think about the steps you can take to move towards greater initiative.
