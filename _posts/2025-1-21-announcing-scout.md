Today, I’m excited to launch my first iOS app: **[Scout Reader for Farcaster](https://scoutreader.app/).** (*[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scout-reader-for-farcaster/id6740188182)*)

Scout is a read-only [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) client that eliminates the need to create or manage a decentralized ID while letting users dive into the content and discussions on the network.

I built Scout for myself first. As a Farcaster user since June 2022, I often miss casts from friends. While user notifications are helpful, they’re easy to lose track of. Without an inbox, it’s nearly impossible to stay organized.

Scout is designed around two core ideas:
1. **Power users** want to subscribe to casts from their top 5–10 accounts. Scout complements their Farcaster experience perfectly.
2. **New users** want to explore Farcaster’s content and community before fully committing. Scout serves as another on-ramp to Farcaster and the broader crypto ecosystem.

This app is my way of giving back to a platform that’s given me so much. Honestly, I wouldn’t be at Shopify if it weren’t for Farcaster. That’s why Scout is completely free to use. Plus, I don’t collect any user data, beyond Apple’s install metrics.

Building Scout was also a personal experiment. While I’m technically minded, I’m not a coder. Pair me with Cursor AI, though, and Scout is the result. It’s given me a greater appreciation for development and made it very clear the world is about to be inundated with code. 

I can’t wait to see what users think. If you’re interested in Scout, you can:
1. Explore the [features](https://scoutreader.app/).
2. Download the [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scout-reader-for-farcaster/id6740188182).
3. Share it with friends.
4. Follow me on Scout or [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/murdo). 
5. Leave an App Store [review](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740188182?action=write-review).
