title: Gaming Is
---

I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this. I’m not scared of what they will think or perhaps even do, I just like to keep it to myself. 

Being an only child, I tend to deal with things on my own, in my own way (I probably shouldn’t) and gaming is one of the best resources I have. It is much more than just entertainment.

My life has been full of those moments which change the way you look at things. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at a young age and instantly I was given a list of don’ts and cant’s. No child wants to have their dreams crushed so quickly but mine were.

You see, I have always wanted to be in the military. Militaria has been a big part of my life thanks to my Dad and our ongoing collection of World War II memorabilia; it is a great passion of mine. Unfortunately, Crohn’s disease prevents anyone from enlisting in any of our armed forces.

Every careers evening I attend or enlisting station I see, I ask if the rules have been changed. I never walk away smiling. 

I know there are plenty of other options offering the same experience of the army closer to home. These ideas are always simmering at the back of my mind but it wouldn’t be the same.

Enter, games. I’m probably part of a small minority but they are much more than just entertainment. Feel free to tell me I’m looking too much into it all, I won’t listen though. Ask anyone on my friends list, I play First Person Shooters a lot! Hours have been poured into Call of Duty, Medal of Honour and the like. I’ve bought all the classics and as many of the Collector’s Editions I can find.

Each of the more recent titles, I have completed three or four times on both consoles and no matter how extravagant the story may seem, I love them. They fill a void in my mind. There’s no can’ts or don’ts. I can live my dream for those seven or eight hours and no-one asks me for any medical conditions I may have.

Games are a way for me to escape. My life is not awful by any standards. I’m happy. But every day, I wish things were different. When I fight side-by-side with Captain Price and team, things are different. I become immersed and I love it. I’m somewhere else.
