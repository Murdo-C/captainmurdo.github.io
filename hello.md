**I'm a creative strategist and product manager who specialises in mobile-driven experiences and new business models.**

I help organisations rethink their customer experiences, design digital services, and adapt their business model as a result. I typically work as a strategy or product/service design lead. You can learn more about my work [here](/work.md/). I'm based in Toronto, Canada but my work takes me places. I pride myself on my versatility and curiosity.

Throughout 2020 I ran a newsletter, <a href="https://neobanked.substack.com">Neobanked</a>, that was published on Sundays every two weeks. The archive of issues lives [here](/newsletter).

In early 2021, I launched [Wall Street’s Best](https://wallstreetsbest.app) - an iMessage sticker app based on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) memes. Launching weeks before the initial GameStop saga, it ultimately reached Top 50 in the iMessage app store.

I studied Actuarial Science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and have since gained my [CIMA/CGMA](https://www.cimaglobal.com/Members/Your-Membership-Information/The-CGMA-Designation/) qualification. I'm also a [ScrumMaster](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/mconnochie) and a [Saltire Scholar](https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/news/archive/2013/saltire-society-12709.htm).

I enjoy 📱, ☕️, 🎙, and 📖.

I live with my wife, Michelle, and our two Chihuahuas, Belle and Meeko in 🇨🇦. We moved here from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 in 2021.
