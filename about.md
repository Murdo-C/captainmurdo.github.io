Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, I am a Management Consultant helping clients design their customer experiences. This is a collection of my thoughts, work and other musings.

I studied Actuarial Science at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh and have since gained my CIMA qualification.

I am fascinated by technology’s ability to transform customer experience and unlock new business models. I typically work as Strategy Lead or User Research Lead. I have worked across Banking, Insurance, Government, Social Housing, Transport and Higher Education.

I enjoy technology, coffee, and reading.

I live with my fiancée, Michelle, and our two chihuahua's, Belle and Meeko.
