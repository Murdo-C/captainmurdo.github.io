title: Neobanked - 018 Annual report season 

---

Different neobank strategies give different fundamentals.

---

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 018 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

It continues to feel like Monzo, Revolut, and Starling are running the same race - perhaps at different paces and optimising for different metrics - whilst Curve tries to adjust the running track to compete without them noticing. N26 bowed out early, blaming Brexit, and it’s been reassuring to see no neobank casualties from the pandemic (yet).
