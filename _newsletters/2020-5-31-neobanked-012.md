title: Neobanked - 012 Building on the new normal 

---

Banks come to grips with the situation and turn back to product development.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 012 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

Business banking remains a key focus for many Neobanks - the pandemic may present a singularly unique opportunity to switch and acquire customers from traditional banks as they discover their existing digital offering isn’t able to deliver. They now must deliver additional value to build on the new customer behaviours and ensure high retention; government backed loans may in fact offer a strong 12 month commitment to provide the Neobanks with some runway to to so.
