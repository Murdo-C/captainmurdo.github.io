<p>Type 8w9 INTJ with ENTP tendencies when it suits the mission, <em>aka a candid leader who can adapt to the situation</em>.</p>
<p>I value precision, ambition, and speed. My default mode is <em>progress over perfection</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m highly responsive on Slack – @Murdo. </p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>I expect a lot from myself—and from everyone I work with.</p>
<ul>
<li>I let my imposter syndrome motivate me to learn and grow.  </li>
<li>If you’re on my team, I trust that you hold yourself to similarly high standards. But I will verify it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Winning matters to me, and I believe winning means moving forward—even if the steps are small.</p>
<ul>
<li>Done beats perfect, but “done” should never compromise quality.  </li>
<li>If it feels like we’re stagnating, let’s address it ASAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>I default to action more than the average person.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll write the first draft, gather the relevant people, or make a quick decision—whatever we need to move forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect you to make decisions without me and be accountable for actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you come to me, I’ll usually put it back on you with “What do you want to do?” and help you decide. If it’s a new space for you, I’ll help navigate the options.  </li>
<li>You should know your actions and when they are due, and I trust you to get them done.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="work-philosophy">Work Philosophy</h2>
<p>People grow most during unreasonable timeframes in stretch domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll push you because I want to see you thrive.  </li>
<li>I believe you can always surprise yourself with what you’re capable of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be a solution finder, not a problem explainer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone’s job description is fundamentally “solve problems.”  </li>
<li>If you’re stuck, don’t hesitate. DM, email, or call me, and we’ll fix it together.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I prefer clarity over formality. Be concise, but don’t sacrifice precision.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume I skim—get to the point fast.  </li>
<li>I value structured, well-written documents over endless discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debate is not conflict. Strong opinions, weakly held, are a superpower.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will challenge you, it may seem aggressive. It’s never personal.  </li>
<li>I will state extreme opinions, mostly so we can tease out why that can't be the case.</li>
<li>If you think I’m wrong, prove it—I <em>want</em> to be convinced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback is a gift. Give examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give it freely and without hesitation. I thrive on it.  </li>
<li>Expect me to do the same for you. It’s how we get better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Context is key. We all have a shared responsibility to inform others.</p>
<ul>
<li>I consume a high rate of information and excel at moving it around an organization.  </li>
<li>But I can&#39;t do it alone; good communication is a form of leverage.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="leadership-style">Leadership Style</h2>
<p>I see my role as a blocker remover and an accelerator for your success.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t tell me, I can’t help you. Speak up.  </li>
<li>I&#39;m good at synthesizing and structuring concepts; use me for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I trust you to be an expert, learn fast, and deliver results.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll get into the weeds with you but expect you to own the outcomes.  </li>
<li>If I override your call, it’s not a lack of trust—it’s about context or priorities. I will provide the why.</li>
</ul>
<p>I value initiative.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can build trust with me by showing you&#39;re action-oriented.  </li>
<li>Identify the first, second, and third order effects of something, then do something about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I build spaces where teams can thrive. </p>
<ul>
<li>I’m not prescriptive about <em>how</em> we do things, but I am about the outcomes we need to achieve.  </li>
<li>I trust my team’s intuition for solutions. We sharpen ideas together.  </li>
<li>Work is my idea of fun, but work should also be fun. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p>I dislike being told what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules are guidelines, not absolutes—unless they’re <em>really</em> good rules.  </li>
<li>If you <em>need</em> me to do something, I&#39;ll need to see your logic. Expect debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s okay to fail—but fail forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistakes are opportunities for growth, not a reason to panic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data-informed > data-driven.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like objectivity but need the context behind the numbers.  </li>
<li>Often our intuition is quicker, cheaper, and more reliable than pursuing the data though.</li>
</ul>
